ü§ù **Looking for partnerships to help our project grow**

Our adventure has only just begun, and to go any further we need your help!

<!--more-->

We're calling on all companies, associations, institutions, foundations and individuals who are interested in **ecology, exploration** and the **preservation of biodiversity**.
Our project revolves around studying biodiversity around the world, understanding conservation policies, and highlighting inspiring local and scientific practices.

**What we are looking for :**


- Equipment (observation equipment, field tools, etc.)
- Funding (however modest, it all counts!)
- Contacts (researchers, NGOs, local players, etc.)
- Resources or information useful for our missions
- Any other kind of support

In exchange, we undertake **to promote our partners** throughout our adventure: visibility on our website, our publications, our interventions, and much more. We believe in the power of collaboration to create meaning and impact.

If our approach resonates with your values, don't hesitate to contact us. We'd be delighted to talk to you about building meaningful projects together.

Thank you in advance for your trust and support.
