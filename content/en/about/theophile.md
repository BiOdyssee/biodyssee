As an environmental engineering student with a passion for entomology and myrmecology in particular 🐜, my aim is to do environmental research, particularly into the genetic dynamics of 🧬🐜 populations (of ants of course). I'm part of the naturalist association ‘les “Blairoudeurs 🦡”’ with which I went out to do some prospecting and awareness-raising in Corsica during the Isula Mission. This gap year project is a great opportunity to continue this experience, but on a much larger and more exotic scale, while continuing to learn about different ecosystems and how they are managed in another country.
