As a student in Environmental Management and Engineering at AgroParisTech, I’m passionate about paleontology and evolution 🦖🦴🧬. I aspire to work in the field of natural area management, specifically in the conservation or restoration of wetlands in France 🐸🐟🌿, which have lost a significant portion of their surface area over the past centuries. I’ve always been fascinated by the evolution of species and ecosystems over time, which is why this gap year project is such a strong source of motivation for me!
