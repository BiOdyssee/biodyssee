Student in Environmental Management and Engineering, I’m fascinated by just about everything related to the ocean 🌊. Wanting to combine work and passion, I’m pursuing a path in marine biology. More specifically, I’d like to work in marine ecosystem conservation or management. I’m deeply passionate about marine wildlife 🐠🐋🐙 as well as aquatic flora, and it’s to get a closer look at it all that I practice scuba diving 🤿. This project is an opportunity for me to explore new aquatic environments 🌊🪸🌿 and better understand the challenges they face.
