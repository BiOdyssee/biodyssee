Student in agronomy and passionate about history 🧭⌛🏹 and ethology 🐁🧠🧪, I hope to use this opportunity to observe animal behavior in their natural environment. Later on, I would like to pursue a career in research 👨‍🔬 or teach in higher education 🧑‍🏫, and this gap year would allow me to develop my analytical and observational skills. The possibility of combining historical research with animal observation — all with the goal of avoiding the mistakes of the past — is what makes this project so meaningful to me.
